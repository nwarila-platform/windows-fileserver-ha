# ansible/inventory/

## There is no static inventory, and that is deliberate

The AWS deploy is **ephemeral**: every run creates a new instance, converges it, and destroys it.
An instance id written into a file here would be wrong the moment the run that produced it ended.

## `aws_ec2.yml` — one run's instance, describing itself

The file is in two parts. The first is the only part that is about this repository: the region, the
four tag filters that select one run's instance — `RepositoryId`, `RunId` and `Repository` from the
workflow's own environment, and `Environment` from `ENVIRONMENT` or `test` — and three composed
groups. `fileserver_nodes` contains the four cluster nodes, `fileserver_witness` contains the
workgroup witness, and overlapping singleton `fileserver_cluster_former` selects the exact Name
tag `tcnaw-hafs01a`. It is an identity contract, not the first host after sorting. Everything below
that is carried unchanged by any repository deploying a host this way.

Hosts are named by their **Name tag**, which is the hostname Terraform declares, so
`inventory_hostname` is the system's own name and nothing downstream has to be told it again. Every
attribute the plugin publishes is namespaced with `aws_`, which keeps the EC2 instance `state` from
colliding with the role input that selects `present_windows.yml` or `absent_windows.yml`.

## Everything else is derived from the instance

| Value | Derived from |
|---|---|
| Operating system, login account, shell type | `platform_details`, which every instance carries and which names the platform it is licensed as |
| Connection, port, address, SSM proxy | the `Connection` tag |
| `ENV` (the framework loader's input) | the `Environment` tag |
| Private key | `CI_PRIVATE_KEY` when the workflow staged one, else the account key pair |

The `Connection` tag takes four values, and absent means `ssh-direct`:

| Value | Reaches the host by |
|---|---|
| `ssh-direct` | SSH to the routable address on 22 |
| `ssh-ssm` | SSH to the instance id, tunnelled by an SSM `ProxyCommand`; needs no inbound rule |
| `winrm-direct` | WinRM over HTTPS to the routable address on 5986 |
| `winrm-ssm` | WinRM over HTTPS to a local port an SSM port-forwarding session already holds open |

A WinRM leg also needs a password, because WinRM has no key authentication; the SSH legs
authenticate with the key pair.

## Running the playbook by hand

Export `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_ID`, `GITHUB_RUN_ID` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` plus AWS credentials, then
point `-i` at `aws_ec2.yml` while the instance still exists. Set `ENVIRONMENT` if the deployment is
not the default `test`. The play asserts its ownership contract, so a run whose tags do not match
fails closed.
